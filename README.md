# FileEditor
This program uses a graph data structure to keep track of files and folders that were made while the program is running. Once the program ends, the program has no memory of the folders or files that were made. The creations are relative to where the program is running.

I compiled BST.cpp and driver.cpp using version 17 (g++ -std=c++17 BST.cpp driver.cpp -o <executable name>).
